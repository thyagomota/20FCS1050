Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shinny nose
and if you ever saw it
you would even say it glows.
All of the other reigndeer
used to laugh and call him names,
they never let poor Rudolph
join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve,
Santa came to say "Rudolph with
your nose so bright,
woun’t you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him,
as they shouted out with glee,
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer,
you’ll go down in history.
